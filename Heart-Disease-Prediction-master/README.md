# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Predicting the presence of heart Disease using Machine Learning models.

## Model Development.
Data set is availabe through Kaggle which consists of 303 rows. 
Reading the notebook through jupyter notebook or google collab will make it easy to understand dataset.
Also, after using various machine learning model such as Linear Regression, SVM, Decision Tree etc. we have K Neighbour Classifier giving the 
highest probability (0.87).
The dataset consists of 13 attributes and the 14th attribute being '1' and '0' which decides whether the individual shows the presence of heart disease
or no respectively. Again read the notebook which has breif description of every step.

## GUI
Using tkinter to generate a simple dialog box which takes input for all the values necessary for evaluation.
Since training the model requires merely milliseconds we train model using KNeighbour Algorithm everytime the input is taken from the user.
After the input is taken, prompt appears which decides whether individual has a presence of heart disease or no.

#### Feel Free to email me for any other quries. :)
#### This project is part of my University Mini-Project and thus has a very basic form of functionalities and interfaces.
